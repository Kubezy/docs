<h2 className="text-lg my-8 font-bold">File Formatting</h2>
<br/>
In Kubezy Docs, we use a specific file formatting to get all the data
from our Github repository.

<br/><br/>
<h3 className="text-base my-4 font-semibold">File Name</h3>
<br/>
If you already looked around our repo, you must've noticed that all directories
and files start with `000-`. This is the sorting number of the directory.
Every file and folder needs one, and it is used to sort the directories
in the sidebar in [docs.kubezy.com](http://docs.kubezy.com).

<br/><br/>
<h3 className="text-base my-4 font-semibold">Metadata</h3>
<br/>
All files need to have a metadata section. For example, this doc's metadata
looks something like:

<div className="bg-slate-700 rounded-md w-auto">
```ts

</div>

where `id` is the document's identification, `title` is what we see,
and `date` is the creation date of this documentation. `tags` is an array of
tags seperated by spaces. Essentially,
all the information you need to change for your contribution is the
text inside the quoation marks.

<br/>
`id` must be formatted using only characters, numbers and '-' instead of spaces.

`date` must be formatted like `MM-dd-yyyy`

`author` must be your GitHub username

<br/><br/>
<h3 className="text-base my-4 font-semibold">Text Formatting</h3>
<br/>
Displaying the text is a bit different from a classic `.mdx` file. While
we support formatting like **bold** and *italic*, we can't support
text formatting like `# Heading`.

To format your documentation, you can use the html elements
alongside [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes.
