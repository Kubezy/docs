<h2>File Formatting</h2>

In Kubezy Docs, we use a specific file formatting to get all the data
from our Github repository.

<h3>File Name</h3>

If you already looked around our repo, you must've noticed that all directories
and files start with `000-`. This is the sorting number of the directory.
Every file and folder needs one, and it is used to sort the directories
in the sidebar in [docs.kubezy.com](http://docs.kubezy.com).


<h3>Metadata</h3>

All files need to have a metadata section. For example, this doc's metadata
looks something like:

```ts
---
id: 'contributing-to-kubezy-docs'
title: 'Contributing to Kubezy Docs'
date: '4-20-2024'
---
```

where `id` is the document's identification, `title` is what we see,
and `date` is the creation date of this documentation. Essentially,
all the information you need to change for your contribution is the
text inside the quoation marks.


`id` must be formatted using only characters, numbers and '-' instead of spaces.

`date` must be formatted like `MM-dd-yyyy`


<h3>Text Formatting</h3>

Displaying the text is a bit different from a classic `.mdx` file. While
we support formatting like **bold** and *italic*, we can't support
text formatting like `# Heading`.

To format your documentation, you can use the html elements
alongside [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes.
